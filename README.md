Comments: (THE GAME IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT..!!)

Ofcourse, this is not a fully-fledged snake game but the focus was put on learning and implementation... Since the game is created in python which is OOP language, its class implementation would have been appreciated...
Moreover..the expectation was to submit it here after some modifications and there by introducing some new rules...
